# QnA_Google_Palm

The Project uses Google Palm LLM with a custom vector database to answer the questions asked by the user related to the admission, fees or any other possible question to Tech Master Coaching Institute. The aim of the project is to reduce the manual work of the of institute by automating the QnA section of it, so the institue does not have to answer the repetative question. Later new question can be added to the database to avoid anwering them manually.

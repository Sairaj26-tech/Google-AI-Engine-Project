# MetaGenAI ðŸ‘‹
Where Data Meets Clarity
 ## Overview

This repository hosts tools designed to automate the extraction of metadata from datasets, enhancing data understanding and management. Leveraging cutting-edge AI models, our tools provide robust capabilities for schema extraction, outlier identification, contextual metadata generation, skewness detection, and semantic context understanding, specifically tailored for Parquet and ORC file formats.

## Features

Schema Extraction: Automatically extract schemas from datasets to understand their structure and organization.
Outlier Identification: Identify outliers within datasets to ensure data quality and reliability.
Contextual Metadata Generation: Generate rich contextual metadata to provide deeper insights into the data's meaning and context.
Skewness Detection: Detect skewness within datasets, enabling better data distribution understanding.
Semantic Context Understanding: Utilize advanced AI models to understand the semantic context of data, enhancing interpretation and analysis.

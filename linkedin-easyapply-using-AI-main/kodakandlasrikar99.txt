## ABOUT ME
- Deep understanding of machine learning and deep learning algorithms, avoiding the perception of them as black boxes, with a clear understanding of the inner mathematics.
- Experienced in end-to-end development in a startup environment, solving problems solo, from data preprocessing and ML modeling to deploying solutions on GCP.
- Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer known for making complex problems seem easy by developing custom techniques, deep learning architectures, and posing the problem perfectly with constraints for ML algorithms to learn patterns in the data easily.
- Keen on staying updated with the latest advancements in deep learning, particularly in Generative AI, through daily research on new techniques and architectures.
- Also interested in the stock market and making money by trading using Machine learning.
- Also have experience in solving time series problems using deep learning and classical ML algorithms.
## WORK EXPERIENCE
### Machine Learning Engineer  
**IDfy | Bengaluru, Karnataka**  
*Oct 2022 - Present (Started at CrimeCheck.ai and later acquired by IDfy)*
- **Disposition Extraction:**
  - Task: Find and extract the current status or final outcome of the case from the court record.
  - Developed a custom deep learning architecture with problem-specific constraints, achieving a 0.91 F1 score across all Indian court records.
  - Successfully handled end-to-end processes, including preprocessing, modeling, and deployment on GCP.
- **Legal Chatbot and Sales Chatbot:**
  - Created Legalbot using fine-tuned open source GPT model (OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B) to answer legal questions related to Indian acts and their sections.
  - Salesbot designed to handle questions related to CrimCheck sales and products.
  - Managed end-to-end processes, including preprocessing, modeling, and deployment on GCP. Legalbot is currently used by HDFC Bank client in real-time.
- **Petitioner and Respondent Extraction:**
  - Task: Extract names, ages, and addresses of both petitioners and respondents from all Indian court records.
  - Employed a custom architecture surpassing Named Entity Recognition (NER) in performance while being computationally efficient.
  - Achieved superior results at a lower computational cost for over 25 crore court records.
  - Successfully managed end-to-end processes, including preprocessing, modeling, and deployment on GCP TPU.
- **Rebuilt Crime Search:**
  - Rebuilt the core crime search algorithm using a custom BERT-like architecture.
  - Fine-tuned architecture on extracted Petitioner and respondent information for relevant address ranking.
  - Project is currently in the testing phase.
- **FIR Information Extraction:**
  - Developed an end-to-end information extraction pipeline for Indian FIR documents using ChatGPT API.
  - Extracted data used to train a custom NER model for identifying key entities in FIR with high precision.
### Machine Learning Engineer Intern  
**SkyGoal | Vijayawada, India**  
*Jul 2021 - Oct 2021*
- Built a chatbot for exams and result-related information, adapting to daily changes in data for efficiency.
- Used KD tree (similar to KNN) on a small dataset for question-answer similarity, deploying the model on AWS.
- The chatbot is live on WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook messenger, and SkyGoal Education website.
## ACCOMPLISHMENTS
- Picasso of Tech award for 2023 at IDfy: Recognized for achieving state-of-the-art results in every NLP problem worked on.
- 2nd Prize winner - Bigghack Hackathon organized by IDfy, May 2023: Tackled a complex video analytics computer vision problem using deep learning in 36 hours.
## PERSONAL PROJECTS
